It's that time of year again when the fees rise.

For NHS courses of starting from today onwards, the patient charges will be:

- Band 1: £18.50
- Band 2: £50.50
- Band 3: £219.00

If you had started a course on or before the 31st March, the 2013 fees will still apply until that course of treatment is completed.
