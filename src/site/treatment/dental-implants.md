Our practice is pleased to be able to offer dental implants to replace teeth which have been lost through accident, decay or gum disease.

A dental implant is a small post made of either pure titanium or titanium-zirconium alloy. It is surgically placed into the jawbone under local anaesthetic where a tooth is wanted. Once fitted into the jaw bone, the bone bonds to the implant surface within a couple of months. It can then be used as an artificial root to build the visible part of a tooth.

We use Straumannâ„¢ implants because they have excellent reserch and we believe they provide the best solutions for our patients. Further information is available on their website
