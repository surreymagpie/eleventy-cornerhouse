The patient examination, or check-up, is carried out at the patient's first visit and at subsequent intervals to monitor the patient's oral health and check for changes.

First of all, the dentist will want to know if there is any medical condition or prescribed medication that needs to be considered. Next, he and the patient have a short discussion to communicate if there are any particular concerns or problems that the patient would like checked.

The dentist will carefully check the teeth and any existing restorations, assess the gums using a special probe and examine other soft tissues around the mouth. He would be looking for signs of tooth decay, gum disease and other diseases.

Once this is complete, he will report his findings and explain what may need to be done and any options the patient may like to consider. If no treatment is required, a suggestion for the timing of the next examination appointment, e.g. in six months or a year, will be made.
