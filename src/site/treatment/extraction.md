Despite the enormous advances made in dentistry over recent decades, it is often still necessary to remove teeth. The most common reasons for this are:

- Extensive decay, especially when the decay reaches below the gum line or little of the crown part of the tooth remains.
- An Abscess which has not responded following root-canal treatment or RCT is not possible
- Advanced periodontal disease which has made the tooth very loose and susceptible to localised gum infection.
- Orthodontics, to make room for the remaining teeth to be rearranged. This is the only common reason to remove a healthy tooth.
- Fractures, whether the result of an accident or injury, or a crack through a tooth which may arise occasionally due to the patient's bite, grinding habit or weakening through previous fillings.

To extract a tooth, the dentist administers local anaesthetic around the tooth. Once this has been allowed time to work and the effectiveness has been checked, the tooth can be removed. Although many patients worry that the procedure will be painful, the only feeling is of pressure being applied. In fact, once the tooth is out, patients frequently ask "Is that it?". The patient will be given a swab to bite on to stem bleeding as necessary and instructions given regarding looking after the area while it heals.

It is normal for the site to be sore to touch but there should be no deep pain following extraction. If this occurs, it may be a sign of a post-operative infection and the dentist should be consulted for advice and treatment as soon as possible
